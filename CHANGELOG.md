# Changelog

Dated releases, newest first. Installed copies pick up kit changes (each with a note in
[updates/](updates/)) and new matching lessons through `/morph-update`; this file lists every change.
When releases are cut: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § Releases.

## Unreleased

- Plugin icon (`.claude-plugin/icon.png`) for the Claude plugin directory listing.
- `/morph-init` no longer downloads the Morphness source itself: it uses its own plugin folder or a
  clone the user names. `/morph-share` asks for the showcase handle instead of reading it with `gh`.

## 2026-10-13

- New `/morph-update` skill, and [UPDATE.md](UPDATE.md) for agents without the plugin. It lists the
  kit updates and community lessons added upstream since a copy last synced, explains why each fits,
  and applies only what the owner accepts, merging with local edits instead of overwriting them.
  Declined updates are never offered again; deferred ones come back next time.
- Kit changes now ship with an update note in `updates/`, checked by `scripts/check-updates.sh`.
- Every prune checks upstream read-only and lists pending updates in the proposal (`SETUP.md` § Prune,
  `templates/prune.md` § 3c). `harness.config.yml` → `installed_from` gains `release` and `updates`.
- `/morph-doctor` now only counts pending upstream items and points to `/morph-update`.
- New optional `ci-cd` module. `/morph-init` can now set up pipelines (CI that runs the named checks
  on pull requests, an owner-run deploy workflow, and the migrations workflow the data-access module
  refers to), each one offered separately and written only when you say yes. Agents write pipeline
  files but never run deploys or migrations. `/morph-doctor` reports CI that has drifted from
  `project/CONTROLS.md`.
